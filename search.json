    "title": "Intro to Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Intro\nAs a contributor to the Kaskada open-source project, I’ve always been driven by the immense potential of today’s technology. In this post, I’ll discuss my learnings around fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). As an example, I’ll use my work on BeepGPT, where I set out to build a customized, real-time model to predict which Slack conversations might different users find interesting?\nFirst, I’d like to say that I am not a Data Scientist. I’ve worked with a few Data Scientists, but my knowledge in the space is limited. With the advent of high-quality LLMs, software engineers like me can now delve into Data Science with little-to-no Data Science background.\nSo, why should you care? Because the line between Data Science professionals and enthusiasts like you and me is becoming delightfully blurred. Dive in to explore how I ventured into the domain of Data Scientists and what I uncovered along the way.\n\nHere are a few tips before we get started\nFirst is a willingness to experiment. Model fine-tuning is an iterative process. The first way you build your training examples will likely not produce a successful model. When working on BeepGPT I experimented with five different approaches (over a week) before I found one that was successful at predicting user interest.\nSecond is the importance of data quality. When fine-tuning a model, numerous training examples are sent to a model to update its behavior. The examples must contain strong signals that relate to the desired output. Despite the recent advances made with LLMs, garbage in still leads to garbage out. (see: Ron Ozminkowski, PhD 2021)\nOne trick I developed was using LLMs to help make decisions about the quality of each example. With few-shot learning, I taught a model what strong signals look like, and I was able to use that to enhance the quality of my dataset.\nFinally, it is vital to have many training examples. Ideally, a fine-tuning job should be run with at least a few thousand training examples. The more examples you can provide to the model, the more it can learn, and the better the predictions will be in production.\n\n\n\nDefinitions\n\nLarge Language Model (LLM)\nA large language model is an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. (Sean Michael Kerner 2023)\n\n\nTokens\nLLMs process text as tokens instead of as characters. Tokens represent sets of characters that commonly occur in a specific sequence. On average, a token represents about four characters. You can use OpenAI’s tokenizer tool to see how different texts get converted into tokens, for example:\n\nTeam, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\n\nThe color highlighting shows how 41 characters become 11 tokens. You can mouse over to see the actual token values.\nCommon words and most positive integers under 1000 equate to a single token. Whitespace and capitalization matter:  Team,  team, Team, and team equate to four different tokens.\n\n\nPrompts & Completions\nPrompts are the input to LLMs. If you have played with ChatGPT before, the request you sent was a prompt.\nCompletions are the outputs from LLMs. With ChatGPT, the response to your question was a completion.\n\n\nTraining Examples\nTraining examples are prompt & completion pairs. The prompt is the text we would have sent to the model, and the completion is the response we would have expected.\n\n\nMaximum Token Length\nThe maximum length of an API request to a model, in tokens. Depending on the model, there is a different maximum length.\n\n\nFew-Shot Learning\nFew-shot learning is a method of working with language models to improve response quality for specific tasks. It works by including training examples on each request to a model, demonstrating the desired response behavior. For example, when playing with ChatGPT:\n&gt; I'd like you to identify if an animal passed to you is a bird or not-a-bird. Here are some examples:\n&gt; Penguin: bird\n&gt; Rabbit: not-a-bird\n&gt; Parrot:\n\nPenguin: bird and Rabbit: not-a-bird are Few-shot examples.\n\nFew-shot learning helps adapt an existing LLM to perform a new task quickly. However, it is limited by the Maximum Token Length of the model. If you are trying to train a model to do a complex behavior, you might not be able to include all your desired training examples in a single request. Additionally, the cost and response time increase as the number of tokens you send increases.\n\n\nModel Fine-Tuning\nFine-tuning is the process of re-training existing base language models (like GPT3) with new datasets to perform specific tasks. Fine-tuning improves on few-shot learning by training on many more examples than can fit in a single request.\nContinuing the previous example, we could fine-tune an existing model by providing a file containing hundreds of animals labeled bird or not-a-bird. The output of this would be a new model that would be more efficient at this specific task.\nMaking requests to a fine-tuned model is generally cheaper and faster than sending few-shot learning requests. However, the process of fine-tuning a model itself can be quite expensive.\nIt is important to weigh the tradeoffs between few-shot learning and model fine-tuning.\n\n\n\nBuilding Training Examples\n\nHypothesis generation\nBefore we start building training examples, you need to form hypotheses about what you want to predict and how you might do so successfully. This is where the iterative process starts.\nFor BeepGPT I experimented with the following ideas:\n\nFor a set of recent messages in a channel, try to predict:\n\nThe reaction (if any) to the most recent message\nThe next user that will reply\nThe set of users that might interact next (reply or react)\n\nFor the set of recent messages in a conversation, try to predict:\n\nThe set of users that might interact next\nThe next user that will reply\n\n\nNote that I didn’t initially develop all of these ideas, only the first one. I built out training examples for each idea and tried to fine-tune a model. When the results weren’t as good as expected, I moved on to the next idea. Experimentation is key.\nUltimately, I was most successful with the final idea: Predict the next user to reply to the set of recent messages in a conversation. The rest of the post will focus on this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI used Kaskada to iterate on these ideas quickly. Kaskada is a tool that makes it easy to collect and aggregate events from raw data. You don’t need to preprocess anything. Just import the raw events and start experimenting. Furthermore, Kaskada ensures that your examples will not be subject to leakage, which is a big problem in predictive modeling. In a future post, I’ll show how I used Kaskada to generate training examples for each of the above ideas.\n\n\n\n\nExample construction\nConsider this conversation:\n\nUserA: Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\nUserB: Yes, I love Mexican food.\nUserA: &lt;@UserC&gt; I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here: http://tinyurl.com/4k53dc8h, but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\nUserB: UserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\nUserA: I can wait for UserC to return.\nUserC: I can help with this. Can you tell me more about your application? Does it have any persistent storage requirements?\n\nReviewing the definition of Training Examples, it states: “Training examples are prompt & completion pairs. The prompt is the text we would have sent to the model, and the completion is the response we would have expected.”\nIn BeepGPT, remember that we are trying to predict who might respond next in a conversation. We want the model to understand how users interact based on their interests, social relationships, responsibilities, etc. Therefore, we build the prompt from the previous messages in the conversation. For the completion, we will use the event we extracted from our data (the next user to reply) as the training signal.\nFrom the first two messages in the conversation, we can generate a training example. The prompt is the first message, and the completion is the user that responded:\n\nprompt: Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\ncompletion: UserB\n\nInstead, if we consider the last four messages we can build another training example. Note, we use two new-line characters (\\n\\n) to join messages:\n\nprompt: &lt;@UserC&gt; I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here: http://tinyurl.com/4k53dc8h, but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\\n\\nUserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\\n\\nI can wait for UserC to return.\ncompletion: UserC\n\nWhen using the OpenAI fine-tuning API, each training example should be a blob of JSON in a specific format on a single line. Converting our two examples above, we now have the following:\n{\"prompt\": \"Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\", \"completion\": \"UserB\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"&lt;@UserC&gt; I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here: http://tinyurl.com/4k53dc8h, but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\\n\\nUserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\\n\\nI can wait for UserC to return.\", \"completion\": \"UserC\"}\n\n\nFormatting examples\nNext, there are several formatting rules that you are recommended to follow. I don’t understand why these are recommended, but I followed them anyway.\n\nAll prompts should end with the same set of characters. The set of characters used should not occur elsewhere in your dataset. The recommended string for textual input data is \\n\\n###\\n\\n.\nAll completions should start with a single whitespace character.\n\nApplying these rules to our examples, we get:\n{\"prompt\": \"Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" UserB\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"&lt;@UserC&gt; I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here: http://tinyurl.com/4k53dc8h, but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\\n\\nUserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\\n\\nI can wait for UserC to return.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" UserC\"}\n\n\nTraining example cleanup\nFinally, I found that model training works best if the following is done:\n\nNon-textual data like http-links, code blocks, and IDs are removed from the prompts.\nCompletions are reduced to a single token in length.\n\nWe can use regex and other string functions to remove non-textual data from the prompts. And we can use standard data science tools like the Scikit-Learn LabelEncoder to create a mapping from UserIds to integers. Remember that positive integers under one thousand map to unique tokens.\nSo now we have:\n{\"prompt\": \"Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" 1\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here:, but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\\n\\nUserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\\n\\nI can wait for UserC to return.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" 2\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRemoving IDs was especially helpful. Before I did so, the model essentially learned how to map from input UserId to output user. It skipped learning anything valuable from the actual text of the messages.\n\n\nWe now have two training examples that we could use for fine-tuning a model.\nIdeally, for fine-tuning, we would have several thousand examples. Using a tool like Kaskada, generating examples like this from your entire Slack history should be relatively easy.\n\n\n\nRefining Training Examples\nBefore proceeding with fine-tuning, I recommend taking the following steps:\n\nUse few-shot learning to determine which examples contain strong signals to be helpful.\nUse the OpenAI CLI to validate that the training examples are in the correct format.\n\n\nDetermining signal strength\n\nOverview\nI found that it is best if each training example contains strong signals to predict your desired outcome. If an example doesn’t have enough signal, you should consider excluding it from your training set.\nDepending on your goal, including some negative examples may also be helpful. Negative examples help train the model about when not to make a prediction or stated another way, about when to predict that no action should be taken.\nFor example, with BeepGPT we are trying to predict when a set of messages might be interesting for a specific user. If we look at our training examples from the previous section, the first does not contain anything interesting. We would not want to alert anyone about this message. Therefore, we should convert this example into a negative example.\nThe second example does contain a strong signal. Here, we would like to alert users who have previously answered questions about Kubernetes. This example should be left as is.\nTo convert an example to a negative one, we must change its completion to indicate a non-response. I chose to use  nil for this, which is represented by a single token in OpenAI.\n{\"prompt\": \"Team, did you enjoy the nachos yesterday?\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" nil\"}\n{\"prompt\": \"I'm trying to get my application deployed in Kubernetes. However, I can't determine whether to use a deployment or a stateful set. I found some docs here: but I'm still unsure which to choose. Can you help?\\n\\nUserC is at lunch now. They will be back in about an hour. I don't know much about this either, but I can try to help. Or is it okay to wait until UserC returns?\\n\\nI can wait for UserC to return.\\n\\n###\\n\\n\", \"completion\": \" 2\"}\n\n\nAutomating this process\nInstead of manually going through each generated example to determine if it should be positive or negative, we can use a model with few-shot learning to do this work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Changer\n\n\n\nI developed this trick of using few-shot learning to improve training data quality. It didn’t seem like it would work initially, but it was surprisingly effective. I think this is potentially a game-changing technique for enhancing the fine-tuning of LLMs.\n\n\nTo start with few-shot learning, we need to find a few examples that we will provide to the model to make decisions on our behalf. Look through your generated examples and try to find 20-30 for each bucket: positive and negative. Add these to files: examples_pos.jsonl and examples_neg.jsonl\nPositive (strong signal) examples:\n\nI’ve been utilizing the Rust syntax highlighter for my code blocks. It does a good job of differentiating between functions and literals.\nThe agent doesn’t push to Prometheus; this is just another proxy location that Prometheus scrapes.\n\nNegative (weak signal) examples:\n\nThere are some very interesting ideas here. thx for sharing.\nWere there any issues with this? I’ll start verifying a few things in a bit.\nStandup?\n\nWe will now use OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API with few-shot learning to iterate over our complete set of training examples and label each as positive or negative.\nFirst, we will generate an instruction set for the model by building up an array of messages in JSON. Each message object contains role and content properties. The role can be either system, user, or assistant.\nThe first message should always be from the system role and provide general instructions to the model of its function. Following this, message pairs of user and assistant should be added, where the user content is our example input and the assistant content is our expected response from the API. The model uses these few-shot training examples to help it determine our desired output.\nThen, we append a final user message to the instruction set containing the content we want evaluated.\nOpen the code folds below to view some example Python code for performing this refinement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips & Warnings\n\n\n\n\nThis will cost a fair amount on OpenAI. A rough estimate is $50 per 10,000 examples.\nThis can take a long time to run to completion. The ChatCompletion API limits the number of tokens used per minute. In my experience, running 10,000 examples through this process takes about 8 hours.\nThe code is written in blocks to run inside a Jupyter Notebook environment.\nIf you want to run the code yourself, you will need an OpenAI API key.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode: install required packages\n%pip install openai backoff numpy pandas scikit-learn\n\n# We use the `backoff` library to retry requests that have failed due to a \n# rate-limit error. Despite this addition, sometimes the process stalls and\n# must be manually restarted. The code below appends to the output file instead\n# of replacing it, so that the process can be resumed after an error occurs.\n\n# numpy pandas scikit-learn are standard data science libraries we\n# will use later in the process for a variety of tasks\n\n\n\n\nCode: import packages and init openAI with your API key\nimport backoff, getpass, json, numpy, openai, pandas, sklearn, time\n\nopenai.api_key = getpass.getpass('OpenAI API Key:')\n\n\n\n\nCode: init a bunch of stuff\n# This code assumes that you have a file named \n# `examples.jsonl`, which contains the full set \n# of training examples generated above.\n\n# get a total count of examples in the input file\ntotal_count = 0\nwith open(f'examples.jsonl', 'r') as in_file:\n    for line in in_file:\n        total_count += 1\n\n# initialize a progress counter\nsuccess_count = 0\n\n# build up the instruction set for few-shot learning\n\n# start with a `system` message that provides the general instructions to the model\nsystem_instructions = \"You are a helpful assistant.

The tool does the following for us:\n\nEnsures that all prompts end with the same suffix.\nRemoves examples that use too many tokens.\nDeletes duplicated examples.\n\nWe can run the CLI tool directly from a Python Jupyter Notebook with the code below.\n\nfrom types import SimpleNamespace\n\nargs = SimpleNamespace(file='examples_refined.jsonl', quiet=True)\nopenai.cli.FineTune.prepare_data(args)\n\nThe output of the above command should be two files:\n\nexamples_refined_prepared_train.jsonl -&gt; We will use this to fine-tune our model\nexamples_refined_prepared_valid.jsonl -&gt; We will use this to validate our fine-tuned model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe output from the CLI tool will include a command for starting a model fine-tuning. I recommend you skip those instructions and use mine below instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Fine-Tuning\nNow that we have refined training examples, we can fine-tune a model.\n\nUpload training data\nFirst, we upload the refined examples to OpenAI. We must ensure the file has been successfully uploaded before moving on to the next step.\n\n\nCode: upload training data\ntraining_file_name = \"examples_refined_prepared_train.jsonl\"\n\n# start the file upload\ntraining_file_id = openai.cli.FineTune._get_or_upload(training_file_name, True)\n\n# Poll and display the upload status until it finishes\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(2)\n    file_status = openai.File.retrieve(training_file_id)[\"status\"]\n    print(f'Upload status: {file_status}')\n    if file_status in [\"succeeded\", \"failed\", \"processed\"]:\n        break\n\n\n\n\nCreate a fine-tuning job\nNext, we create a fine-tuning job using the file_id from the upload.\nWhen doing fine-tuning, you need to choose a base model to start from. The current options are:\n\nada -&gt; Capable of very simple tasks, usually the fastest model in the GPT-3 series, and lowest cost.\nbabbage -&gt; Capable of straightforward tasks. Very fast and low cost.\ncurie -&gt; Very capable, but faster and lower cost than Davinci.\ndavinci -&gt; Most capable GPT3 model. It is more expensive to train and run in production.\n\nYou must also choose the number of epochs to train the model for. An epoch refers to one full cycle through the training dataset.\nThe cost of fine-tuning is based on the base model, the number of examples, and the number of epochs you will run. Generally, doubling the number of epochs doubles the training cost. However, there is a trade-off to consider here because cheaper base models will be cheaper to run in production.\nWith the example set I was using for BeepGPT, I found that eight epochs on curie produced a model with a similar capability as four on davinci. Depending on your use case, you may or may not have a similar result.\n\n\nCode: create a fine-tuning job\ncreate_args = {\n    \"training_file\": training_file_id,\n    \"model\": \"davinci\",\n    \"n_epochs\": 4,\n    \"suffix\": \"beep-gpt\"\n}\n\n# Create the fine-tune job and retrieve the job ID\nresp = openai.FineTune.create(**create_args)\njob_id = resp[\"id\"]\n\n\n\n\nWait for the job to finish\nAfter the fine-tuning job has been created, we need to wait for it to start processing and then for it to finish.\nDepending on the current backlog at OpenAI, I’ve seen that jobs can take up to a dozen hours to start.\nAfter the job starts successfully, you can see its status and wait for it to finish. This can also take a long time. When using davinci with four epochs, I estimate about 1 hour per 1000 training examples.\n\n\nCode: wait for the job to finish\n# Poll and display the fine-tuning status until it finishes\nfrom IPython.display import clear_output\n\nwhile True:\n    time.sleep(5)\n    job_details = openai.FineTune.retrieve(id=job_id)\n    \n    print(f'Job status: {job_details[\"status\"]}')\n    print(f'Job events: {job_details[\"events\"]}')\n    clear_output(wait=True)\n\n    if job_details[\"status\"] == \"succeeded\":\n        model_id = job_details[\"fine_tuned_model\"]\n        print(f'Successfully fine-tuned model with ID: {model_id}')\n\n    if job_details[\"status\"] in [\"failed\", \"succeeded\"]:\n        break\n\n\n\n\nUsing the fine-tuned model\nNow that we have a finished model, we can try sending a few prompts and see if it recommends alerting any users. We can use the validation file for this.\nSee the OpenAI docs for info on the parameters we send to the Completion API.\n\n\nCode: send requests to the model\n# choose which row in the validation file to send\nrow = 6\n\ncount = 0\nwith open(f'examples_refined_prepared_valid.jsonl', 'r') as in_file:\n    for line in in_file:\n        count +=1\n\n        if count &lt; row:\n            continue\n\n        data = json.loads(line)\n        prompt = data[\"prompt\"]\n        completion = data[\"completion\"]\n\n        # this is the text we send to the model for it to \n        # determine if we should alert a user\n        print(f'Prompt: {prompt}')\n\n        # this is the user (or nil) we would have expected \n        # for the response (from the validation file)\n        print(f'Completion: {completion}')\n\n        # this is the response from the model. The `text` field contains \n        # the actual prediction. The `logprobs` array contains the \n        # log-probability from the 5 highest potential matches.\n        print(f'Prediction:')\n        openai.Completion.create(model=model_id, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=1, logprobs=5, temperature=0)\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Validation\nYou can run your model over the full validation data set to validate it. Then, use a basic data science performance measurement to check the quality of your model. I calculate the model’s F1 Score in the example below, but you can use other performance indicators if desired.\n\n\nCode: run the model on the validation data set\nwith open(f'examples_refined_prepared_valid.jsonl', 'r') as in_file:\n    with open(f'examples_refined_prepared_valid_pred.jsonl', 'w') as out_file:\n        for line in in_file:\n            # for each example in the validation input file\n            # run the completion API using our fine-tuned model\n            # write the results to the output file\n            pred = openai.Completion.create(model=model_id, prompt=prompt, max_tokens=1, logprobs=5, temperature=0)\n            data[\"prediction\"] = pred\n            out_file.write(json.dumps(data) + '\\n') \n\n\n\n\nCode: calculate the f1 score\n# load the results from above into a dataframe\ndf = pandas.read_json(f'examples_refined_prepared_valid_pred.jsonl', lines=True)\ndf[\"test\"] = None\ndf[\"pred\"] = None\n\n# fill the test and pred columns in the dataframe \n# from the Completion API results\nfor i in range(len(df)):\n    completions = df['completion'][i].strip().split()\n    df.at[i, \"test\"] = completions\n    prediction = df['prediction'][i]\n    if \"choices\" in prediction:\n        predictions = prediction[\"choices\"][0][\"text\"].strip().split()\n        df.at[i, \"pred\"] = predictions\n\n# drop rows where \"pred\" is null\ndf = df[df.pred.notnull()]\n\n# compute the 'macro' F1 score. also can try \n# the 'micro' or 'weighted' score based on need\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nf1 = f1_score(df['test'], df['pred'], average='macro')  \nf1\n\n\nAn F1 score is a measure of a model’s accuracy, and it takes into account both precision and recall.\n\nPrecision is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive predictions. It measures how accurate the model’s positive predictions are.\nRecall is the number of true positive predictions divided by the total number of positive cases. It measures how well the model identifies positive cases.\n\nThe F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F1 scores range from 0 to 1, with a score of 1 indicating perfect precision and recall and 0 indicating poor performance. As a general rule of thumb, an F1 score of 0.7 or higher is often considered good.

Through the example of BeepGPT, we saw that the process, while requiring patience and iteration, can produce models that offer valuable insights.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nExperimentation is vital: Training a model that works efficiently requires much trial and error. As showcased with BeepGPT, sometimes the fifth attempt may be the charm!\nExperimentation is vital: Training a model that works efficiently requires much trial and error. As showcased with BeepGPT, sometimes the fifth attempt may be the charm!\nFew-Shot Learning – A Game-Changer: In the midst of refining BeepGPT, I stumbled upon an innovative trick: leveraging few-shot learning to elevate the quality of our training data. While it seemed unconventional at first, the results were staggering. This technique might just revolutionize the way we fine-tune LLMs in the future.\nPrioritize Data Quality: Even with tricks up our sleeve, the core principle remains - garbage in equals garbage out. The essence of a model’s efficiency lies in the caliber of data it’s trained on.\nComprehensive Training Examples: Building and refining a large set of training examples ensures a model can predict accurately in real-world scenarios.\n\n\n\nNext Steps\n\nDeep Dive into Tools: In future posts, I’ll explore Kaskada more deeply, showcasing how it aids in simplifying the process of gathering and refining training examples.\nOptimization: As technology evolves, so do the tools and strategies for model fine-tuning. I’ll explore strategies to optimize the training process, from reducing costs to increasing accuracy.\nModel Deployment: With a validated model, the following steps involve deploying it into real-world applications. In upcoming posts, I’ll look at strategies and best practices for integrating models with various platforms.\nFeedback Loop: Continuous improvement is a hallmark of successful machine learning. We’ll explore ways to gather feedback on model predictions, further refining and improving it over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the landscape of data science and machine learning is more accessible than ever. With the right tools, patience, and curiosity, even software engineers with minimal data science experience can harness the power of advanced models to provide tangible value. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a newcomer like me, the journey of discovery and innovation in this space is just beginning.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nNeri Van Otten. 2023. “F1 Score The Ultimate Guide: Formulas, Explanations, Examples, Advantages, Disadvantages, Alternatives & Python Code.” https://spotintelligence.com/2023/05/08/f1-score/.\n\n\nRon Ozminkowski, PhD. 2021. “Garbage In, Garbage Out: Saving the World Is Just One Good Reason to Address This Common Problem.” https://towardsdatascience.com/garbage-in-garbage-out-721b5b299bc1.\n\n\nSean Michael Kerner. 2023. “Definition: Large Language Model.” https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/large-language-model-LLM."
