    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, I'm going to discuss my learnings around fine-tuning OpenAI GPT models. As an example, I'll use my work on [BeepGPT](https://github.com/kaskada-ai/beep-gpt), where I fine-tuned a model to predict which conversations might be interesting to users of a Slack workspace. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this post focuses on using the legacy GPT3 models. I'll make a future post about working with the latest generation models from OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll cover the following topics in detail below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Building Training Examples\n",
    "* Refining Training Examples\n",
    "* Model Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "But before I get started, I'd like to discuss a few things. \n",
    "\n",
    "First is a willingness to experiment. Model fine-turing is an iterative process. Most likely the first way you will build your examples will not produce a successful model. When working on BeepGPT I experimented with five different scenarios (over a week) before I found one that was somewhat successful at predicting user interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second is the importance of data quality. When fine-tuning a model, numerous training examples are sent to a model to update its behavior. The examples must contain strong signals that relate to the desired output. Despite the huge advances made recently with LLMs, garbage in still leads to garbage out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally it is important to have many training examples. Ideally a fine tuning job should be run with at least a few thousand training examples. The more examples that you can provide to the model, the more it can learn, and the better the predictions will be in production."

    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tokens\n",
    "Tokens represent sets of characters that commonly occur in a certain sequence. On average, a token represents about 4 characters. You can use OpenAI's tokenizer tool to see how different texts get converted into tokens: https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the text: \"Hey team, how was your weekend?\" gets tokenized as: [10814, 1074, 11, 703, 373, 534, 5041, 30]. 31 input characters become 8 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "With color highlighting we how each set of characters was transformed:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-0\">Hey</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-1\"> team</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-2\">,</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-3\"> how</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-4\"> was</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-0\"> your</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-1\"> weekend</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-2\">?</span></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's models process text as tokens instead of as characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompts & Completions\n",
    "Prompts are the input to LLM models. When working with ChatGPT, the prompt is the question we ask the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completions are the responses from LLM models. When working with ChatGPT, the completion is the model's answer to our question. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training Examples\n",
    "Training examples are prompt & completion pairs. The prompt is the text we would have sent the model in production, and the completion is the response we would have expected back. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Maximum Token Length\n",
    "The maximum token length of a request to a model, including both the prompt and completion. Depending on the model, there is a different maximum length. For fine-tuning, we need to make sure that each training example is less than this size."

    "## Building Training Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start building training examples, we need to form hypotheses about what we want to predict and how we might do so successfully. \n",
    "\n",
    "For BeepGPT I experimented with the following ideas: \n",
    "\n",
    "* For a set of recent messages in a channel, try to predict:\n",
    "  * The reaction (if any) to the most recent message\n",
    "  * The next user that will reply\n",
    "  * The set of users that might interact next (reply or react)\n",
    "* For the set of recent messages in a conversation, try to predict:\n",
    "  * The set of users that might interact next\n",
    "  * The next user that will reply\n",
    "\n",
    "I was most successful at fine-tuning a model for the final idea: For the set of recent messages in a conversation, predict the next user to reply. The rest of the post will focus on this."

Furthermore Kaskada ensures that your examples will not be subject to leakage, which is a big problem in predictive modeling.

    "Before sending training examples to OpenAI to fine-tune a custom model, you should ensure they contain a strong signal for predicting your desired outcomes.

Negative examples help train the model about when to not make a prediction, or stated another way, about when to predict that no action should be taken. \n",

If we look at our training examples from the previous section, the first does not contain anything interesting. We would not want to alert anyone about this message. Therefore we should convert this example into a negative example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second example does contain a strong signal. Here we would like to alert users that have answered questions about kubernetes in the past. This example should be left as is.\n",
    "\n",
